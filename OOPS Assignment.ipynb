    "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Class: \n",
    "A blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Object:\n",
    "An instance of a class. Objects have attributes (data) and behavior (methods) defined by their class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Encapsulation: \n",
    "The practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components. This helps protect the integrity of the data by preventing external interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Inheritance: \n",
    "A mechanism that allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and logical hierarchy in class relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Polymorphism: \n",
    "The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions, with the specific action determined by the type of object that implements the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles form the foundation of OOP, enabling code modularity, reuse, and flexibility."

    "\n",
    "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python determines the order in which classes are searched when invoking a method or accessing an attribute in the presence of inheritance, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios. When you call a method on an instance, Python follows the MRO to find where that method is defined.\n",

    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "- The MRO determines the sequence in which base classes are checked when a method is called.\n",
    "- In single inheritance, the MRO is straightforward: the class itself and its direct parent classes are checked in sequence.\n",
    "- In multiple inheritance, Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to ensure a consistent and unambiguous resolution order.\n",

    "#### How MRO Works:\n",
    "- For single inheritance, the MRO is simple: it follows the class hierarchy from the current class to its parent classes, and ultimately to the built-in object class.\n",
    "- For multiple inheritance, Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the order in which classes are considered. It ensures:\n",
    " ##### 1. Child class first: \n",
    " The class itself is checked first.\n",
    " ##### 2. Depth-first, left-to-right: \n",
    " Python checks base classes in a depth-first, left-to-right order, meaning it searches the base classes in the order they are inherited.\n",
    " ##### 3. No class is repeated:\n",
    " Each class appears in the MRO only once, even if it appears multiple times in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- **MRO** determines the order in which base classes are searched for a method or attribute.\n",
    "- **C3 linearization** is the algorithm Python uses to ensure a consistent and unambiguous search order.\n",
    "- You can retrieve the MRO using the __mro__ attribute or the mro() method."

    "The __str__ method is used to define the string representation of an object.\n",

    "    \n",
    "When you use print() on an object or call str() on it, Python uses the __str__ method to determine what to display.\n",

    "The __add__ method defines how two objects of the class should be added together using the + operator.\n",

    "In the example, __add__ is overridden to add two ComplexNumber objects by separately adding their real and imaginary parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "When you write c1 + c2, Python automatically calls the __add__ method, returning a new ComplexNumber object that represents the sum of the two.\n",

    "What These Methods Allow You to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Operator Overloading: By overriding __add__, you can define how the + operator works for your objects, enabling intuitive mathematical operations that align with the nature of the objects (e.g., adding complex numbers, points, etc.).\n",
